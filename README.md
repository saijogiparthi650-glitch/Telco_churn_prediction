# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of the coursework using Python and Google Colab.

The goal is to analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that help predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service.
